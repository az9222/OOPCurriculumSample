/*
Create a Husky class, in pseudoclassical style:
	- Call the dog superclass
	- Set the prototype
 	- Set the constructor
	- An age property set to 10
	- A job property that is set to ‘chase squirrels’
	- A color property inherited from Dog that is set to grey
	- A food property inherited from Puppy
	- An eat method inherited from Puppy
	- A ‘squirrels caught’ property set to 0
	- A ‘catch squirrel’ method that adds 1 to that ‘squirrel’s caught’ property
	- A ‘give squirrel’ method that subtracts 1 from ‘squirrel’s caught’ property
*/
